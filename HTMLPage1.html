            <h1>Welcome to the World of Cakes!</h1>
            <p>Cakes are a delicious form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>
            <p>They are often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. Their rich history and endless variations make them a beloved treat around the globe.</p>
